# Getting Started

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.

The HTML of our project can be found by navigating to src -> app.  Once in that folder you will find folders containing all of the components that make up our web application.  With the exception of models and services each folder contains a HTML, CSS, SPEC, and TS file that are directly related to that section.  Global CSS properties can be found in the styles.css file found within the src folder. Images and fonts can be found in the src/assets folder.

When this application is deployed to FTP angular compresses all of the components and css files into a much smaller package so the FTP contents will look slightly different and will likely be minified to save space on the server.

We are using deploy.hq to automate our deployment process.  This is triggered by committing to the master branch of our github site.  Development is done in branches and tested for errors before pushing to master so that only working code is deployed.
